  - Removed unnecessary language features
  - Enhanced Canvas-specific autocompletion
  - Improved editor performance settings
- **Developer Experience Benefits**:
  - Better autocompletion for Canvas APIs
  - Reduced editor overhead
  - More relevant suggestions for Canvas development

### 7. Content Security Policy Implementation
- **Files**: `public/_headers`, `src/utils/securityHeaders.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive CSP headers for multiple deployment platforms
  - Implemented CSP violation reporting
  - Added security headers for XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks
- **Security Benefits**:
  - Prevents code injection attacks
  - Blocks malicious external resources
  - Provides defense in depth

## üîí Security Features Summary

### Code Execution Security
- **Web Worker Sandboxing**: All user code runs in isolated web workers
- **Execution Timeouts**: 10-second maximum execution time
- **Safe Globals**: Only safe objects (Math, console, canvas APIs) are available
- **No DOM Access**: User code cannot access document, window, or global objects

### Input Validation
- **File Size Limits**: 100KB maximum file size
- **Content Filtering**: Blocks dangerous patterns (eval, Function, DOM access)
- **Extension Validation**: Only .js and .txt files allowed
- **Content Sanitization**: Removes HTML tags and dangerous code patterns

### Network Security
- **CSP Headers**: Strict Content Security Policy preventing XSS
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security for secure connections
- **Frame Protection**: X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking
- **Content Type Protection**: X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME sniffing

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Memory Management
- **Bounded Execution**: Limits on execution time and memory usage
- **Proper Cleanup**: Animation frames and timers are properly cleaned up
- **Content Limits**: File content is limited to prevent memory exhaustion

### File System Performance
- **O(1) File Lookup**: Memoized file map for instant access
- **Optimized Tree Operations**: Better algorithms for file tree manipulation
- **Project Statistics**: Monitoring capabilities for performance tracking

### Editor Performance
- **Canvas-Optimized**: Editor configured specifically for Canvas development
- **Reduced Overhead**: Disabled unnecessary language features
- **Better Suggestions**: More relevant autocompletion for Canvas APIs

## üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Security

### Netlify (_headers)
Ready-to-use security headers configuration for Netlify deployment.

### Multi-Platform Support
Security header configurations provided for:
- Netlify
- Vercel
